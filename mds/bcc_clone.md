## Summary

This project came from an inspiration of looking back at the aesthetics and styles of websites and trying to see how it was achieved. It eventually turn into a project in which I knew it would enrich my CSS skills as this became of my earlier works of me doing the custom CSS portion.

## Explanation

I took my time with this project, I looked at the organization and formatting of the site and knowing when to properly create a different section for the site. It was mainly a form of practicing with HTML tags and CSS color and aligning for this sort of project.

The website took 3 days to finish and was finished sometime January 2016.

## Challenges

Some of the issues coming into this project was properly organizing where and when html tags needed to go, as at the time when I was working with div tags, I had to tell when it was appropriate to close it without forgetting anything to be added in; sort of like constructing a modal and how it contains different sections like header, footer, etc.

As for a similar problem coming into this project I had to figure out a way to break down different sections of the site as some portions were vertical or horizontal.

## Solutions

Organizing the html tags came with understanding the process of learning how html tags are properly incorporated and I also learned this when working alongside div tags with Bootstrap css classes in other projects.

The breaking down of sections for the css styling was a new challenge and came to the conclusion the best solution was including a created css class that had the clear method and thus allowing the opportunity to break down the website into portions without any clustered html being bundled together.

## Conclusion

For a project like this, I'm happy how it turn out, other improvements I could see myself doing is adding upon the site, however my decision at first not to do so was the fact that the BBC site deisgn was auto generating and never-ending scrolling new stories thus having no end on where the page would stop loading.
