## Summary

The project idea came from looking upon how most applications on the IOS store advertise themselves by creating information and marketing pages on the internet. This gave me motivation to try something like this on my own and provide a good opportunity work more in depth with Twitter Bootstrap.

This project was created back in March 2016 and took 1-2 days to complete.

## Explanation

This website adversities a fake business and uses mainly Twitter Bootstrap for the styling, It is more for cosmetic then functionality as there are no actual provided links nor sign up functionality on the site.

## Problems

Problems I face during the development process was finding a way to incorporate a modern nav bar as well a sign in form without being too clunky or filling up too much information on the screen due to fact I didn't wanted the site to look too overwhelming with text.

## Solutions

To first solution for the nav bar and the reason for incorporating one in the first place was to help viewers navigate throughout the page easier and inform what type of information they would find in this page, that being a small explanation and features the application provides and where they can sign up for more information, and as well provide them details where they can find and install the product. 

I implemented the nav bar using Twitter Bootstrap and one of the problems I had during development was the fact that how I was gonna link the information section the nav bar links, I solved this using custom ids on the different sections and tying those ids to the hyper reference links on the Nav bar tabs.

Another problem was finding a way to incorporate a sign up on the page without being on the page directly nor create a new page/link for it. I resolved this using a modal provided by the Bootstrap. This created a pop-up sign up from clicking the green sign up button on the page. This way the sign up information could still be on the page without needing to creating a different section of it own.

## Conclusion

For how the project turned out and the look of the site, I'm happy to say I'm satisfied with it and turned to be what I envision the finish look to look like.
