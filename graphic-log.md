## Summary

This project idea came from the client(Marine Lighting Services) a few months back asking for different variant amounts of ship logos they could use, I provided some designs for them. 

This project was finished back in May 2016 and now the final design is now the logo for the upcoming company's checks and business cards. The two designs below are concept designs during development.

## Explanation

The concept of the designs revolved around oil tankers as the company is an oil transportation company as well adding old fashion ship wheel due to the client's requests. The colors I choose were blue and white as those are the company's primary colors as well requested the marine aspect.
